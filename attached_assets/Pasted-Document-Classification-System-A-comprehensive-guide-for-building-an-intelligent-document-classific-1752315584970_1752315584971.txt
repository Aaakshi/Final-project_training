Document Classification System
A comprehensive guide for building an intelligent document classification system that can automatically categorize business documents by department and priority level.

7.	Operations
8.	Customer Support
9.	Procurement / Purchase

Priority Classification
High Priority (Time-sensitive, urgent, requires immediate action)
Category	Keywords/Phrases
Deadlines	by EOD, by end of day, by today, asap, urgent, immediate, within 24 hours, deadline today, due today, respond by, reply immediately
Action Requests	action required, requires immediate attention, please review urgently, high priority, critical issue, resolve now
Escalations/Issues	escalated, service disruption, breach, incident, system down, customer complaint, payment failed
Meetings/Events	today's meeting, final review, must attend, confirmation needed
Medium Priority (Important but not urgent — typically this week or within a few days)
Category	Keywords/Phrases
Follow-ups	reminder, follow up, this week, pending, awaiting response, check status, update needed
Upcoming Deadlines	by tomorrow, due in 2 days, schedule by, before Friday, complete by, ETA
Meetings	scheduled for, calendar invite, tentative, planned discussion, agenda
Tasks	work in progress, assigned, need update, submit by, to be reviewed
Low Priority (Informational, long-term, or low urgency)
Category	Keywords/Phrases
FYI/Reference	for your information, no action needed, for record, just sharing, reference document, read only, optional
Long-Term	next quarter, next month, future release, roadmap, tentative plan, long-term goal, backlog item
General Updates	weekly summary, monthly report, feedback, draft version, notes, not urgent
Implementation Approaches
1. Rule-Based Classification
Start with a baseline keyword matching system using the provided keywords for each department and priority level.
2. Machine Learning Models
Enhance the rule-based system with:
•	TF-IDF + Logistic Regression/SVM
•	BERT-based classifier (fine-tuned for your document corpus)
•	Spacy or Transformers for Named Entity Recognition and similarity-based classification
3. Multi-Label Classification
Train a classifier to predict both department and priority simultaneously for more efficient processing.
Usage Guidelines
1.	Keyword Matching: Build a regex or keyword matching system to assign priority_level: high | medium | low
2.	NLP Enhancement: Combine keyword matching with NLP models or TF-IDF ranking for dynamic results
3.	Multi-Label Training: Train models to predict both department and priority labels simultaneously
4.	Continuous Learning: Regularly update keywords and retrain models based on new document types
Getting Started
1.	Implement the keyword-based classifier as a baseline
2.	Collect and label your organization's documents
3.	Train ML models on your specific document corpus
4.	Integrate with your document management system
5.	Monitor and improve classification accuracy over time
Best Practices
•	Start with rule-based classification for quick implementation
•	Gradually introduce ML models for improved accuracy
•	Regularly update keyword lists based on organizational changes
•	Use feedback loops to continuously improve classification performance
•	Consider document context and organizational structure when fine-tuning
