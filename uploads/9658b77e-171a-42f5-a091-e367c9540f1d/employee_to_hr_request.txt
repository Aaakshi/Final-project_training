Subject: Request for Remote Work Flexibility and Annual Leave Balance Inquiry

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request the possibility of a flexible remote work schedule for the next three months, starting from August 1, 2025. This request is due to some unforeseen family responsibilities that require my presence at home during weekdays, though I will ensure that my productivity and deliverables remain unaffected.

I have reviewed our organization’s remote work policy and am confident that I can meet all expectations while working from home. I will be available during all working hours, attend daily stand-up calls, and share weekly reports as usual. I also have a dedicated and fully equipped workspace to maintain seamless communication and collaboration with the team.

Additionally, I would like to request an update on my current annual leave balance. I am planning a short trip in mid-September and want to ensure that I plan appropriately without disrupting any ongoing projects.

Please let me know if you require any supporting documentation or a formal application through the employee portal. I am happy to comply with all standard procedures.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Akshi Agarwal
Marketing Executive

Subject: Follow-up on Previous Requests and Training Session Nomination

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

Further to my earlier message, I would also like to follow up on two additional matters.

1. **Nomination for Training Session**: I would like to express my interest in the “Advanced Digital Marketing & Analytics” training session scheduled for August 2025. As my role involves campaign performance analysis and social media strategy, this training would help me enhance my contribution to the team. Please let me know the nomination procedure and any prerequisites required.

2. **Update on Employee Insurance Coverage**: I recently received communication regarding optional health insurance add-ons. I would appreciate it if the HR team could share more clarity on the enrollment window and whether dependents can be included in the plan.

I look forward to your response and guidance on the above topics. Please feel free to reach out to me for any additional information.

Warm regards,
Akshi Agarwal
Marketing Executive
